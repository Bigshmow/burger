# EatDaBurger
### This is the EatDaBurger app: https://eatdaburger-bigshmow.herokuapp.com

## EatDaBurger is a burger logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom built ORM by me.  Once you're done requesting a burger order, the app allows you to "Devour" each burger and then sends the burger to the devoured side of the page.  I used Node and MySQL to query and route the data, with Handlebars used to generate the view in this MVC framework.

### The goal of this project was to demonstrate working knowledge of MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars along with building our own ORM to help with extra SQL code.  We were also tasked with keeping our MVC framework clean and each task specialized throughout the process.  I was able to add some audio and fade effects in order to keep the user from requesting duplicate orders.
